📌 Project Overview

This project is a machine learning model designed to estimate the probability of university admission based on a student’s academic profile.

The model outputs an admission probability between 0 and 100%, based on SAT, GPA, and research experience.

It demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow from data preparation, model training, evaluation, to prediction.

🧠 Features Used
Feature	Description
SAT	SAT score (scaled to realistic ranges)
GPA	High school GPA (on 4.0 scale)
Research	Research experience (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

These features reflect academic rigor and intellectual engagement, central to most university admissions processes.

🛠️ Machine Learning Workflow

Manual dataset creation (for demonstration & academic use)

Feature/target separation

Train–test split

Linear Regression model training

Model evaluation using R² score

Custom profile prediction

The project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline from data to inference.

📈 Model Output Example: Predicted Chance of Admit: 84.9%

⚠️ This is a probabilistic estimate, not a guarantee.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project:

❌ Does NOT use official university admissions data

❌ Does NOT guarantee admission outcomes

❌ Is NOT affiliated with any specific university

It is strictly an educational ML project created to demonstrate applied concepts.
