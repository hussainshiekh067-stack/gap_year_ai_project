## Project Overview
This project is a **university-specific machine learning model** designed to estimate the **probability of admission to Dartmouth College** based on a student’s academic profile.

It demonstrates a complete ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation. The model predicts a probabilistic score (0–100%) reflecting Dartmouth admissions criteria in a **simulated, educational context**.

---

## Motivation
During my gap year, I wanted to explore practical applications of **Computer Science and AI** by building a small project relevant to my intended major. Dartmouth College was chosen for its academic rigor and holistic admissions approach.

This project shows my initiative, problem-solving skills, and ability to apply ML concepts in a **realistic but ethical simulation**.

## Features Used
| Feature  | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SAT      | Standardized test score (scaled)               |
| GPA      | High school GPA (4.0 scale)                     |
| Research | Research experience (1 = Yes, 0 = No)          |

These features reflect **core academic competencies** relevant to Dartmouth admissions.

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Dataset creation** (synthetic/manually curated)  
2. Feature-target separation  
3. Train-test split  
4. Linear Regression model training  
5. Model evaluation (R² score)  
6. Prediction for a custom student profile  

The notebooks demonstrate a **full ML pipeline from start to finish**.

## Model Output Example
Example prediction for my academic profile: 

Predicted Chance of Admit: 84.9%


⚠️ This is a probabilistic estimate for educational purposes only and not an official admissions decision.

## Limitations
- The dataset is small and manually created  
- Model simulates Dartmouth admissions, does not use real confidential data  
- Predictions are illustrative, not guaranteed

---

## Future Work
- Expand dataset with anonymized, historical trends  
- Use advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Add user interface for interactive predictions  
- Extend to other universities with customized models

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## Usage & Applications
- Gap-year portfolio showcase  
- GitHub project for CS/AI demonstration  
- Supplement to university applications  
- Demonstrates practical ML skills and ethical project design
