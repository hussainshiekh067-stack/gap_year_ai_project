# gap_year_ai_project

📌 Project Overview

This project is a university-specific machine learning model designed to estimate the probability of admission to Dartmouth College based on a student’s academic profile.

Unlike generic admission predictors, this model is tailored specifically for Dartmouth, reflecting its holistic admissions philosophy and competitive academic environment.

The model outputs an admission probability between 0 and 100%.

🎯 Why Dartmouth-Specific?

Most admission prediction models are overly generic and unrealistic.

This project takes a focused approach:

One university

One admissions context

Clear assumptions

Transparent limitations

This demonstrates critical thinking, model design decisions, and ethical ML usage — not just coding.

🧠 Features Used

The model uses the following inputs:

Feature	Description
SAT	SAT score (scaled to realistic Dartmouth ranges)
GPA	High school GPA (on 4.0 scale)
Research	Research experience (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

These features were chosen to reflect academic rigor and intellectual engagement, which are central to Dartmouth’s admissions process.

🛠️ Machine Learning Workflow

Manual dataset creation (for demonstration & academic use)

Feature/target separation

Train–test split

Linear Regression model training

Model evaluation using R² score

Custom profile prediction

The project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline from data preparation to inference.

📈 Model Output Example

Example prediction:

Predicted Chance of Admit: 84.9%

⚠️ This value represents a probabilistic estimate, not a guarantee.

⚠️ Disclaimer (Important)

This project:

❌ Does NOT use official Dartmouth admissions data

❌ Is NOT affiliated with Dartmouth College

❌ Does NOT guarantee admission outcomes

It is strictly an educational machine learning project created to demonstrate applied ML concepts.

🚀 Applications

This project can be used for:

Gap-year portfolio

GitHub ML showcase

University application supplements

Demonstrating practical ML understanding

🔍 Future Improvements

Larger, real-world datasets (simulated or anonymized)

Non-linear models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Separate models for test-optional applicants

UI/Web interface for public interaction
